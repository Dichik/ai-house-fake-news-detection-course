0,"Most of the messages claiming ostensible Ukrainian escalation appeared on propaganda resources when Russia was concentrating its troops on the shared Ukrainian border, namely twice in April and October 2021. No escalation from Ukrainian side took place beforehand It was not a secret that Russia mobilized its army units along the north, east and south borders with Ukraine already in March 2021. Back then in Bryansk, Voronez, Rostov oblast and on the territory of occupied Crimea RF located its 28 battalion tactical groups put on wartime alert. The troops were relocating under the coverage of military exercises.
According to the Ukraine’s government estimations till May Russia had concentrated up to 100 soldiers along the Ukrainian borders and in occupied Crimea.
Moskow, meanwhile, claimed that it was a response to the Kyiv’s provocations aimed to escalate the conflict in Donbas. The OSCE monitors stated that no provocations were taking place, though.
Moreover, before mobilizing its troops at the borders with Ukraine in spring 2021 it was Russia whose militants reinforced shalling and multiplied its heavy weapon.
Thus the number of cases of violation of the cease-fire regime grew at the beginning of 2021. However, the majority of them were made by Russian militants and NOT Ukrainian troops. The OSCE observations in Ukraine dated January – March 2021 stated 98% of all the cases of cease-fire violations were recorded on the territories beyond Ukrainian government control. It recorded more than 500 weapon units whose location violated agreed withdrawal lines. Approximatelly 95 % of them were in uncontrolled territories.
Russia mobilized its troops again in October, 2021, according to different evaluations, one of the U.S. Mission to the OSCE there were 100 thousands of the at the borders already on January, 30 , 2021 and 169-190 thousand on February, 18, 2022.
The OSCE SMM tendencies in Ukraine for July-September 2021 (the last available quarterly report covering the period before the withdrawal of Russian troops in October) state: 87% of ceasefire violations were recorded in areas not under Ukraine’s control. 77% of equipment violating the diversion lines were also placed on the aforementioned areas.
The Russian Federation allegedly used Ukrainian’ side escalation to justify a full-scale attack on Ukraine in February 2022. However, from 2016 to 2019 (prior to the ceasefire agreement), the OSCE SMM in Ukraine yearly recorded many more fire violations than in 2020 and 2021 (with no data on which party committed the violation – Ukraine or militants). For example, in 2017 more than 400 thousand violations were recorded in a year, and in 2021 – almost 94 thousand.
So, first, in 2021 the escalation in Donbas was no greater than in previous years. Second, this escalation was staged by Russian-controlled militants, not Ukraine. For example, a few days before the Russian attack on February 18, Russian occupation forces fired Ukrainian positions 66 times, 52 of them with weapons prohibited by the Minsk agreements.",0
1,"Not the Revolution of Dignity but Russian aggression led to the war in the East and the occupation of Crimea. Moreover, Russia also attacked on the information front, spreading fakes about brutal right-wing Euromaidan activists who want to deal with the Russian-speaking population of Donbass and Crimea, from which they must be “saved” immediately.
These theses became the basis for the provocation and formation of “republics” that were never really independent. In 2014, during a rally to secede from Ukraine in Donetsk, militants raised the Russian flag and Russian citizens took leadership positions. The “prime minister” of the DPR in 2014, Russian Alexander Borodai, stated later that if it were not for Putin, his policy of decision and action, there would be no Russian Donbass: DPR and LPR.
Russia’s intervention in the war has been proven repeatedly. The regular Russian army, codenamed Ikhtamnet, took part in the battles against the Armed Forces in the summer of 2014, in the winter of 2015, and all the time afterwards, and was also responsible for shooting down MH-17. The presence of the Russian Federation was recognized by the OSCE and Bellingcat investigators : thousands of Russian servicemen took part in the fighting in eastern Ukraine and were awarded medals. Moreover, Russia was systematically increasing its influence in the occupied territories. In particular, in 2020, about 165 Russian passports were issued to residents of the DPR and the LPR and in 2021 – admission to the party «United Russia» and the right to vote in Russian elections. So there can be no question of any civil war.",0
2,"Ukraine, like many other countries, depends on relations with other states and international organizations. However, this is a mutually beneficial cooperation. For example, in cooperation with the IMF, Ukraine is carrying out economic reforms necessary for further development. VoxCheck wrote in detail about cooperation with the IMF in the article “International Monetary Fund: Evil Corporation or saving the economy in a crisis?”.
Assistance provided by the European Union is aimed at developing the economy, public administration, civil society, promoting energy efficiency and protecting the environment in Ukraine. We have already refuted the myths of Russian propaganda about the Association of Ukraine with the EU – “Геть від Євросоюзу”. Російська дезінформація сьомий рік демонізує Угоду про асоціацію між Україною та ЄС”.",0
3,"Not all Donbas residents were against European integration or the democratically elected Ukrainian government in 2014. Euromaidan rallies also occurred in the now occupied Donetsk, where activists rallied for three months. The city’s largest rally took place on March 13, 2014, but it was brutally dispersed. Thousands of civilians had come out to support Ukraine (according to eyewitnesses, 10,000 people rallied in Donetsk). pro-Russian activists staged the massacre and killed 22-year-old activist Dmytro Cherniavskyi during the assault. Official figures said another 36 people were injured. Eyewitnesses said there were more victims.
Evidence of Russian troops and military equipment in Donbas is plentiful, particularly from independent international observers. Read a detailed refutation in the article """"Russia is not an aggressor against Ukraine: a review of Italian and German pro-Russian media"""".",0
4,"Russia’s accusations of supporting the war and nationalist rhetoric by the Ukrainian Orthodox Church are baseless.
First, the Ukrainian Church, independent of Russia, openly declares that Russia has invaded Ukraine and occupied Crimea. Because of its pro-Ukrainian position, Russian propaganda accuses the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of supporting the war.
Second, nationalist rhetoric is not supported by the Ukrainian church or the general population. Defending the national interests, independence, and sovereignty of one’s state is not a manifestation of nationalism but an adequate position in any country.",0
5,"The Malaysian Boeing over Donbass was shot down by Russia from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system, which was brought from Russia to the territory of Ukraine occupied by the Russian militants. Numerous pieces of evidence confirm this fact: About two hours after the crash, one of the militant leaders, Igor Girkin (Strelkov), the “DPR’s” defense minister, published a report that the “DPR” had shot down a Ukrainian AN-26 aircraft near Torez. However, when it became known that it was not a Ukrainian military plane that was shot down, but a passenger plane, Girkin deleted his post. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) intercepted conversations of militants on the day of the catastrophe, where terrorists are probably discussing the downing of the Boeing MH17. A version of the downing of the plane from the Buk anti-aircraft missile system was formed on the basis of these conversations. Independent Bellingcat investigators found that Buk anti-aircraft missile system was transported to the “DPR” from Russia. They confirmed this information with intercepted conversations, satellite photos and social media posts. The Buk which shot down the plane belonged to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Army from Kursk.
The information that the Boeing MH17 was shot down by “DPR” terrorists from the Buk transported from Russia is confirmed by the data of the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), led by the Netherlands.
JIT investigators have named four people involved in the downing of a Malaysian Boeing in June 2019. According to the investigation, Igor Girkin, a former “DPR” defense minister, Oleg Pulatov, a former lieutenant colonel in the Russian Airborne Forces, Sergey Dubinsky, a retired GRU officer, Leonid Kharchenko, a commander of the intelligence unit at “GRU DPR”, a Ukrainian. The first three suspects at the time of the JIT statement were in Russia, and Kharchenko was in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine. All four are suspect of organizing the supply of anti-aircraft missile system.
Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of shooting down a Boeing and tried to provide its “evidence”. However, all this is a lie. For example, in 2015, Bellingcat journalists used digital satellite images from Globe to expose Russia’s lies about the Malaysian Boeing MH17. Investigators have found that the Russian Defense Ministry published fake photos from space on the day of the catastrophe.
The Investigative Committee of Russia also stated that MH17 was shot down by a Su-25 aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force. It is not true.
First, the Su-25 aircraft is designed to destroy tanks and other military equipment from a small height. The Su-25 is not designed to fly higher, and cannot shoot down other aircraft at an altitude of 10,000 km, as flying MH17. Experiments confirm that the Su-25 can rise to an altitude of 10,000 km, but without weapons.
Secondly, the Su-25 is much slower than the Boeing-777, so it could not catch up with the MH17. This was stated by one of the designers of the Su-25 Vladimir Babak and the editor of the military magazine HS Jane’s Defense Weekly Nick de Larrinaga.
Third, around 800 pieces of shrapnel had ripped through MH17. This confirms that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, not an air-to-air missile with much less power. Thus, it is impossible to shot down the plane from the Su-25, how Russia stated.
Russia has called the investigation biased and partial, but has refused to cooperate with other countries. In 2020, Russia withdrew from consultations with the Netherlands and Australia on the MH17 disaster.",0
6,"The energy crisis in the EU was provoked not by the delay in the implementation of Nord Stream-2 , but by the excessive dependence of European countries on Russian gas and revenues from its transit. The sharp rise in gas prices in 2021 is due to both global growth in post-pandemic gas demand and its artificial restriction by Gazprom by cutting supplies to a minimum. As a result, EU countries have not been able to fully fill their gas storage facilities and prepare for the winter challenges: low temperatures and Russia’s launch of a full-scale war with Ukraine.
Nord Stream – 2 is the second stage of the German-Russian submarine gas pipeline across the Baltic Sea with a total capacity of up to 27.5 billion cubic meters of gas per year. The owner is Gazprom , which has invested 9.5 billion euros in the project, half of its value. The rest of the costs were financed by the British oil and gas company Shell, the Austrian OMV, the French Engie and the German Uniper and Wintershall DEA. The launch of Nord Stream 2 was aimed at doubling gas pumping capacity from Russia to Germany, bypassing other countries’ gas pipelines, which would violate EU competition principles and deepen Russia’s monopoly on gas supplies to Europe.
As of March 2022, the project was suspended due to Russia’s recognition of the DPR and LPR and its subsequent invasion of Ukraine, and the Swiss company Nord Stream 2, responsible for construction, has declared bankruptcy. Against the background of intensifying Russian aggression on the territory of Ukraine and destabilizing Russia’s economy through a series of mass sanctions, gas prices reached a record high of 345 euros / MW on March 7.",0
7,"Ukraine has enshrined its desire to become the part of the European community in the Constitution and is developing in this direction. However, it does not mean that Ukraine automatically pursues anti-Russian or nationalist policies. Russia started the war in Donbass in 2014 and annexed the Ukrainian Crimea, so the reasons for anti-Russian sentiment and the impossibility of cooperation at the state level are quite clear and justified. Ukraine has not chosen or pursued a militant and hostile policy towards Russia, we are defending our interests and sovereignty.",0
8,"Neither the Ukrainian government nor the parliament has ever announced its withdrawal from the Minsk agreements
Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has consistently emphasized that Ukraine is not renouncing the Minsk agreements. President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky has never said that the Minsk agreements are invalid. Moreover, in December 2021, he announced that Ukraine had developed a 10-step plan for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements and passed it on to the United States, Germany, France and Russia.
The Ukrainian law on the reintegration of Donbas, adopted in 2018, does not mention the Minsk agreements at all, especially the refusal to comply with them.
It (the Law “On the peculiarities of state policy to ensure the state sovereignty of Ukraine in the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions”) states that Ukraine was attacked by Russia, which is the aggressor and occupier, and the part of the Donbas is occupied by it. And the illegal armed groups “LPR” and “DPR”, which actually control the occupied territories, are “representatives of the occupation administrations of Russia.” The law does not contradict the provisions of the Minsk agreements. But, of course, Russia cannot like it, hiding its participation in the war in Donbas.
Ukraine did not report withdrawing from the Minsk agreements shortly before Russia’s full-scale attack.
Propaganda resources misrepresented the content of the quote from Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to the head of the President’s Office. After the meeting of Volodymyr Zelensky and Joe Biden in September 2021, Arestovych told one of the Ukrainian TV channels that the parties had agreed on the possibility of modernizing the Minsk agreements. And he addressed the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergei Lavrov with the words: “Mr. Lavrov, my best regards to you: we are off the hook of the Minsk agreements.” Shortly before that, Lavrov said that “Russia will not allow Zelensky and Ukraine to” get off the hook of the Minsk agreements“.
Later, Oleksiy Arestovych said that “the Minsk agreements haven’t vanished”, the parties did not announce their withdrawal. He spoke only about the interpretation of the agreements required by Russia: “Well, the news for Lavrov is that the hook of the Minsk agreements no longer exists. Nor the Minsk agreements, namely the hook of the Minsk agreements, that is, the Russian version of their interpretation, which they tried to impose on us and the world community“.
In fact it is Russia, which does not fulfill most of the statements of the Minsk agreements This was the reason for the EU extending sanctions against Russia in January 2022. Russia blocks OSCE observers from accessing certain areas and does not provide humanitarian aid through international mechanisms. Russia does not comply with the security provisions of the Minsk agreements: a ceasefire, complete withdrawal of pro-Russian militants and Russian weapons from Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia claims that it is not a party in the Minsk agreements and is not mentioned in the text. But these documents were signed by Russia’s representative Mikhail Zubarov.
Russia is trying to force Ukraine to implement “Minsk” on its own terms. First, Ukraine must adopt a special status for Donbas, which will give the region significant privileges and put the rest of Ukraine’s regions in an unequal position. Second, Ukraine must agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections are held there. But these elections must be held in compliance with Ukrainian law, which is impossible under the conditions of the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories have received Russian passports. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, mostly from ORDLO, is 1.4 million, and most of them will not be able to take part in the elections.",0
9,"Ukraine sees NATO as a means of preventing Russia’s further aggressive actions. However, no one has turned Ukraine into a “NATO base” yet. There are no NATO troops or military infrastructure on Ukraine’s territory. Military cooperation between Ukraine and NATO is limited to assisting with Ukrainian reforms, consultations, exchanging experiences among the military, and participation of Ukraine’s armed forces units in NATO operations or exercises.
Supplying arms to Ukraine is not done at the NATO level but at the level of individual countries. Ukraine receives particularly significant assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom. These countries began to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine precisely against the backdrop of Russian aggression. In other words, Russia forced Western governments to strengthen Ukraine’s defense capabilities.",0
10,"Speaking about the economic blockade, the propagandists mean the broken social and economic relations between Ukraine and Crimea and some districts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, i.e., the temporarily occupied territories. Ukraine allegedly has robbed its citizens of the opportunity to meet their basic needs.
However, the propaganda cliches are contrary to international law. According to it, the occupying power must ensure the safety of civilians, including by providing them with access to water, food, and medical care. In the case of Ukraine, Russia is the occupier and, therefore, fully responsible for everything happening in the occupied territories.
As for freedom of speech, Ukraine is not a model liberal democracy, but it has shown progress in respect for human rights in recent years. For instance, Ukraine ranked 97th out of 180 in the World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. That is 30 ranking positions higher than in 2014. According to Freedom House, Ukraine scored 60 out of 100 points in 2021 for protecting civil liberties and political rights. In 2014, the country had only 35 points. These indicators are higher for Ukraine than for many post-Soviet countries, e.g., Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, etc.
Analyzing the reports by international organizations, we can see that there are still problems in Ukraine, such as pressure and attacks on journalists and human rights activists, hate speech against various groups, and oligarchs’ influence on the media. However, Ukraine cannot be considered an authoritarian country where all civil and political freedoms are suppressed.
With Ukrainian being the only state language, Ukraine does not deprive national minorities of their right to speak their native languages. Ukrainians are free to use any language in everyday life. National minorities can use their mother tongue to teach in pre-school and primary education institutions (alongside Ukrainian). They can continue studying their native language at the next education level, but they will use Ukrainian in general education.",0
11,"First, the events of 2014 in Ukraine are not a coup d’etat. Allegations of a coup in central Kyiv are typical for the Kremlin’s rhetoric, which justifies its own aggression.
A coup d’etat is an unconstitutional seizure of power by a small group of individuals, conspirators acting in their own interests. The revolution of dignity began with peaceful protests by unarmed people in support of democratization, which the authorities tried to suppress by force, forcing them to use self-defense, and was massive. You can read more about why the Revolution of Dignity is not a coup d’etat in VoxCheck material “Maidan in 2014 is a state coup: overview of Italian and German pro-Russian Media”.",0
12,"Russia was the first to mobilize its troops to Ukraine’s borders – without any threat from Ukraine
In December 2021, Russian politicians, including President Putin and Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, claimed that Ukraine had moved half of its army (or 120,000 to 125,000 troops) to the war zone. They did not release any confirmation of the mentioned data.
Data on the number of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are regularly published on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The information is also available in the passports of budget programs exposed for public access. In December 2021, there were more than 201,000 servicemen in the Armed Forces. Just over 40,000 of them took part in the Joint Forces Operation (JFO). That is three times less than what was said in Russia. For comparison, in February 2021, just over 40,000 servicemen took part in the Joint Forces Operation (JFO). Almost a year before, in May 2020 there had been the same number – 40 thousand.
The number of Ukrainian servicemen in Donbas did not increase. Instead, in October-November 2021, Russia, according to various estimates, drew about 100,000 troops to Ukraine’s borders. There is no evidence, in particular from independent observers, that Kyiv was going to attack Donbas
In the autumn of 2021, Russia once again declared that Ukraine was preparing for the “offensive in Donbas.” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation announced offensive actions of the Armed Forces in the area of Granitny and Staromaryivka (Donetsk region), referring to the reports of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. This is not true: the Mission’s daily reports did not mention this. Instead, OSCE SMM reports during this period revealed the systemic restrictions on freedom of movement in the temporarily occupied territories (for example, here), blocking of communications and surveillance (here), threats to the personal security of international observers by Russian armed forces (here)
The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not open fire first and do not shell civilians and infrastructure in Donbas
The Ukrainian Armed Forces first used the Turkish Bayraktar drone in October 2021. The parties have banned the use of UAVs in the context of a truce signed in July 2020 within the Tripartite Contact Group. The first paragraph states a “ban on the use of any type of aircraft.” But there is also a ban on any “use of fire, including sniper fire” – and this point is constantly being neglected by the Russian occupation forces.
Bayraktar was used as a last resort. The militants fired from 122-mm howitzers prohibited by the Minsk agreements on civilian targets and positions of the Armed Forces near Granitny in the Donetsk region for several days. In addition, Russian mercenaries dropped explosive devices with the help of an unmanned aerial vehicle.
The militants did not stop the shelling even after the Ukrainian side used a standard response mechanism: the OSCE SMM called for a ceasefire. And under the terms of the July 2020 truce, retaliatory fire is allowed in the event of a failed response. Ukraine did not violate the Minsk agreements: Bayraktar did not cross the contact line, the howitzer was destroyed by a guided missile.
In addition, the first drones in Donbas were, in fact, used by militants: Russian UAVs “Orlan-10” have long been recorded in Donbas.
The West did not “pump Ukraine with weapons”, but provided weapons to repel a possible Russian attack
The bulk of the weapons received by Ukraine are anti-tank systems (NLAW, Javelin), which make little sense in the event of the attack of the Armed Forces on uncontrolled territories, but are necessary in the event of an attack by armored vehicles from the Russian Federation.
Russia has been supporting separatists in Donbas since 2014, supplying them with modern weapons, heavy weapons, troops and training. This has been repeatedly confirmed by NATO, Ukrainian and American intelligence",0
13,"Russian propaganda was spread in the churches of the Moscow Patriarchate, so during the war with Russia the independent church was a matter of security and sovereignty of Ukraine. It is incorrect to claim that Petro Poroshenko decided to divide the Orthodox Church. It is not a wish of the state leadership but a forced step for the sake of national security.",0
14,"The Minsk agreements were concluded as a result of the Ukrainian army defeats in 2014-2015, so they cannot be considered beneficial for Ukraine. Conditionally, the Minsk provisions can be divided into security and political parts.
Security
Security includes a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons, exchange of prisoners, access to humanitarian aid.
Russia has not yet ensured its implementation. Nor has it set into action the measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020. The US Mission to the OSCE emphasizes that Russia has not fulfilled any of its responsibilities: it has not stopped firing, has not withdrawn its heavy weapons from restricted areas, and has not provided unimpeded access for OSCE SMM observers. In addition, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Russia has not implemented an all-for-all exchange, has not provided humanitarian aid through international mechanisms, has not allowed socio-economic ties to be restored and has not fulfilled a bunch of other points.
Political part
First, the agreements themselves do not clearly specify the procedure for implementing the provisions. Therefore, Russia cannot claim that Ukraine must first fulfill the political part – to adopt a special status for Donbas and hold local elections.
Secondly, Russia claims that Ukraine should give Donbas autonomy. Whereas in Minsk it is only a matter of “special status” – not autonomy.
The special status for Donbas will give the region significant privileges and make the rest of the regions be in an unequal position. Ukraine must also agree to regain control of the occupied territories only after local elections. These elections must be held under Ukrainian law, which is impossible due to the actual occupation of these territories. In addition, in recent years, Russia has issued its passports to more than 600,000 Ukrainians in the occupied territories. At the same time, the number of temporarily displaced people, most of whom left ORDLO, is 1.4 million. And most of them will not be able to vote in the election. As a result, Russia has significantly changed the situation in the ORDLO and stepped up its intervention.",0
15,"The activation of Ukraine’s cooperation with other countries in the military sphere was not the cause but the consequence of Russia’s very real armed aggression. No matter how much Russia justified its actions, in 2014 it was it that started the war in eastern Ukraine and occupied Crimea. It was Russia that systematically violated the Minsk agreements during the 8 years of the hybrid war.
NATO, in turn, has repeatedly stated that it will not send troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian attack. All members of the Alliance confirmed at the Brussels Summit in June 2021 that “the Alliance does not seek confrontation and does not pose a threat to Russia.”
In January 2022, amid Russia’s disinformation about the border situation, the US Secretary of State’s Office issued a disproof, including on NATO’s plans. NATO did not surround Russia and did not plan to deploy Allied forces in the eastern part of the Alliance until Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea. Multinational battle groups in the Baltic states and Poland were deployed in 2016 in response to Russia’s use of military force against its neighbors. These forces are rotational, defensive and proportional. NATO enlargement is not directed against Russia. Each sovereign state has the right to choose its own security mechanisms and to join regional defense alliances for self-defense. This is a fundamental principle of European security, reflected in the UN Charter, and one that Russia has reaffirmed in many international and regional instruments, such as the Helsinki Final Act.",0
16,"Such statements are unfounded. The Ukrainian authorities are independently responsible for their domestic and foreign policy. Western countries support us, but do not force us to make any changes.
In addition, VoxCheck has already refuted the fake about Soros’s statements about his own earnings during the war in Ukraine and the benefits of it from Europe. George Soros did not make such statements, but instead called on the EU to provide financial support to Ukraine, as Russia’s attack on Ukraine threatens the security of the whole Europe.",0
17,"Ukraine is a strategic partner for both the EU and the United States. Since the beginning of Russia’s armed aggression in 2014, the United States and the European Union have consistently supported Ukraine’s territorial integrity and state sovereignty. This support continues within economic, political, and diplomatic frameworks, where security and defense are key.
Ukraine, like many other countries, depends on relations with other states and international organizations. However, this is a mutually beneficial cooperation. For example, in cooperation with the IMF, Ukraine is carrying out economic reforms necessary for further development.

18,"Ukraine did not steal Russian gas. Similar accusations were made by the Russian side in the 1990s, in 2008 during the gas conflicts, and in 2014. In the latter case, Russia later admitted that the alleged withdrawal of Russian gas from Ukraine was a technical oversight.

19,"U.S. intelligence and independent investigators like Center for Information Resilience and Conflict Intelligence Team warned of the dangerous concentration of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border in late 2021 and early 2022. Evidence of preparations was the Kremlin’s intercepted intelligence plans, a continual build-up of troops at the border with additional personnel and equipment, and the troops’ gradually getting closer to Ukraine’s borders. Troops were concentrated not only in places of permanent deployment but also directly near the border, less than 50 km from Ukraine’s territory. Meanwhile, Russian and Belarusian rhetoric had become increasingly aggressive toward Ukraine.",0
20,"The law on indigenous peoples, like the law on language, is perhaps the most discredited on pro-Russian resources. At the same time, it is commented just in the Russian narrative.
According to the definition in the law, indigenous people are “autochthonous ethnic community formed on the territory of Ukraine, bearer of original language and culture, having traditional, social, cultural or representative bodies, have the self-awareness of the indigenous people of Ukraine, constitute the ethnic minority in its population and does not have its own state entity outside Ukraine”. Among the indigenous peoples are those peoples who were formed on the territory of Crimea – the Crimean Tatars, Karaites, and so on.
Russians cannot be the indigenous people of Ukraine: they have their own state formation outside our country. However, this does not mean that they will be deprived of basic rights in the state.",0

However, no one has turned Ukraine into a “NATO base” yet. There are no NATO troops or military infrastructure on Ukraine’s territory. Military cooperation between Ukraine and NATO is limited to assisting with Ukrainian reforms, consultations, exchanging experiences among the military, and participation of Ukraine’s armed forces units in NATO operations or exercises.
Supplying arms to Ukraine is not done at the NATO level but at the level of individual countries. Ukraine receives particularly significant assistance from the United States and the United Kingdom. These countries began to supply lethal weapons to Ukraine precisely against the backdrop of Russian aggression. In other words, Russia forced Western governments to strengthen Ukraine’s defense capabilities.",0

Further, we present the main theses: 1. When they talk about “historically Russian” lands, they mostly talk about the South of Ukraine, Slobozhanshchyna, and Donbas, which were formed on the territory of the uninhabited Dyke Pole (Wild Field). 2. On the map of 1720, Putin’s “historically Russian” lands belong to either Ukraine or the Crimean Khanate. 3. More than 100 years later, the 1897 census of the Russian Empire showed that the so-called “Little Russian” (i.e., Ukrainian) language dominates not only in modern Ukraine (particularly in the “historically Russian” lands mentioned by Putin) but also goes beyond it. 4. The “similarity” of languages and religions was created artificially by Russia: in 1720, Peter I ordered the publication of books only in Russian, and in 1863 Peter Valuev almost completely banned all printing in Ukrainian; Ukrainians tried to establish their own church as early as 1302, as evidenced by the existence of the Galician Metropolis, abolished by the pressure of Moscow’s Tsar Simeon the Proud in 1347.",0
26,"Ukraine is a strategic partner for both the EU and the United States. Since the beginning of Russia’s armed aggression in 2014, the United States and the European Union have consistently supported Ukraine’s territorial integrity and state sovereignty. This support continues within economic, political, and diplomatic frameworks, where security and defense are key.
The EU supports Ukraine to ensure a stable, prosperous, and democratic future for its citizens. It also unwaveringly supports Ukraine’s independence, territorial integrity, and sovereignty. The Association Agreement, including its Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) signed in 2014, is a crucial tool to bring Ukraine and the EU closer together, promoting deeper political ties, more robust economic ties, and respect for common values.
The DCFTA has increased bilateral trade between Ukraine and the EU, Ukraine’s main trading partner. According to 2021 results, the share of trade in goods and services with the EU amounted to 39% of Ukraine’s total trade.
In addition, since 2014, the EU and its financial institutions have raised over €15 billion in grants and loans to support reforms in Ukraine.
US-Ukraine relations are bilateral relations between two independent countries. Washington is working closely with Ukraine, directing bilateral relations between two independent countries. Washington is working closely with Ukraine, directing support for the country’s democratic development and helping Ukraine counter Russian aggression.
The United States and Ukraine have had a bilateral investment agreement since 2008. The United States-Ukraine Trade and Investment Council was established under an agreement between the two countries on trade and investment cooperation, working on expanding commercial investment opportunities by identifying and removing obstacles to bilateral trade and investment flows.

Under the guise of “protecting Russians and Russian-speaking Ukrainians,” Russia committed aggression against Ukraine in Crimea and Donbas. As a result, the people Russia allegedly cared for have become victims of the conflict, robbed of the opportunity to live a peaceful, secure life. The occupying authorities regularly violate human rights in these territories by resorting to repression.

Stepan Bandera was a prominent figure in the Ukrainian national liberation movement in the 1930s and 1950s, leading the anti-German and anti-Soviet struggle. Later, his name came to symbolize the movement itself. In 1941, he was arrested by the Nazis and put in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp for proclaiming the restoration of the Ukrainian state in Lviv. He refused to cooperate with Germans. From 1942 to 1944, Bandera was in a German concentration camp, and so he could not cooperate with the German military.",0

But the final decision is made only by Germany.
Secondly, gas exports from the United States to the EU actually doubled in January 2022 compared to November 2021, from 1.02 billion cubic meters per day to 1.95 billion cubic meters per day.

The norm of the “language law” on service sector in the Ukrainian language caused the most criticism and fakes.

For example, if it is convenient for a client, a salesman, a waiter, a hairdresser or any other representative of the service sector to communicate not in Ukrainian but in Russian or another language, the law allows it.
In addition, the law regulates only the public sphere, the provisions of the law do not regulate the use of language in everyday life. Therefore, the total ban on Russian is just a fabrication of propagandists.
Penalties for breaking the law, which are reported in the media, are the last and most severe sanction. It is introduced only after several stages of warnings.

39,"The decision to hold a so-called “referendum” was made at a session of the Verkhovna Rada of Crimea on February 27, 2014. By then, the military without insignia had already seized the parliament building. Journalists were not allowed into the hall. Whether there was a quorum for making this decision and how the MPs voted under the barrels of guns is unknown.
In 2015, Igor Strelkov (Girkin), a leader in the operation of taking over Crimea, admitted that the deputies had to be “herded” into the Parliament to vote on February 27.
Two questions were put up for the referendum: “Do you support the reunification of Crimea with Russia as a subject of the Russian Federation?” and “Do you support the restoration of the Constitution of the Republic of Crimea as of 1992 and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?” None of them provided for the possibility of maintaining the status quo.
Crimea’s Constitution as of 1992 provided broad autonomy rights for the peninsula. As if it were a separate state having its governing bodies and “exercising in its territory all of its powers except those voluntarily delegated to Ukraine.”
The “referendum” was also illegitimate from the point of view of Ukrainian laws. According to Article 73 of Ukraine’s Constitution, the issue of changing the territory is decided only at an all-Ukrainian referendum. Whether Crimea should be part of Ukraine had to be agreed upon by all the regions, and the voting of people in Crimea alone was not enough for such a decision.
In truth, the Crimean “referendum” took place without international observers who could document violations. However, Crimean journalists and voters have repeatedly stated that ballots were distributed in a massive way to the same people. They were also given to people with Russian passports.
In 2014, the Venice Commission unanimously adopted an opinion viewing the referendum in Crimea as unlawful and violating, besides the Constitution of Ukraine, basic international principles regarding territorial integrity and sovereignty of subjects of international law.
Neither Ukraine nor the European Union, nor the United States recognized the results of Crimea’s “referendum.” On March 27, 2021, passed a resolution to support Ukraine’s territorial integrity. The European Union adheres to a strict policy of not recognizing illegitimate “referendum” results.

Among the rallies’ organizers were Russian citizens, including Russian neo-Nazi Anton Raevsky, a future militant fighting in Donbas, and Yevgeny Mefedov, later convicted of rioting in Odesa. pro-Russian protesters provoked clashes on May 2. According to “May 2 Group,” an independent research team, Euromaidan and “Anti-Maidan” representatives agreed not to interfere with each other’s mass events on May 2. However,the “anti-Maidan activists” still prevented the march of pro-Ukrainian activists by blocking their way. Clashes broke out on Hretska Street, and pro-Russian protesters shot dead six Odesa residents in the city center.
Pro-Ukrainian activists went to the Kulykove Pole to disperse the anti-Maidan tent camp, but the latter had already relocated to the House of Trade Unions.

manipulative and non-alternative questions: the option “keep in Ukraine” was not provided to participants;

44,"Reports of shelling in the Donbas by the Armed Forces refer to the so-called “People’s Militia of the DPR” and the “People’s Militia of the LPR” which are illegal formations of pseudo-republics. These entities do not provide any evidence of their claims. They are also not confirmed by the data of international observers, namely the OSCE Specialized Monitoring Mission in Ukraine.
Or they distort the data in the OSCE SMM reports. For example, in April 2021, propagandists reported that a child had died in the Donbas as a result of the Ukrainian drone attack. The mission confirmed the child’s death “as a result of an explosive injury and multiple shrapnel wounds.” There is no information that the child died as a result of a drone strike. And the village of Oleksandrivske, where the incident took place, is in the deep rear of the militants – a drone of the Armed Forces of Ukraine simply could not reach it.
In other cases, the militants referred to the JCCC – Joint Center for Control and Coordination on ceasefire and stabilization of the demarcation line. It was organized in 2014 with the participation of the Ukrainian and Russian military.
But at the end of 2017, Russia withdrew from the JCCC due to new entry rules for Russian officers. Their places in the territories not controlled by Ukraine were taken by militants of the so-called “LDPR”, so their messages cannot be called impartial. Ukraine does not recognize the representatives of the self-proclaimed “republics” as part of the Joint Center, and the EU has called on Russia to return its officers to the JCCC.
In most cases, the ceasefire is violated by Russian occupation forces
On July 27, 2020, the agreement on the establishment of a full and comprehensive ceasefire in Donbas went into effect. Russia claims that Ukraine, ostensibly, does not abide by the terms of the ceasefire. This is not true: the OSCE SMM data proves the opposite. For example, reports for 2021: in January-March, 98% of ceasefire cases were recorded in territories not under Ukraine’s control; in April-June, 93% of ceasefire cases were recorded in territories not under Ukraine’s control; in July-September, 87% of ceasefire cases were recorded in territories not under Ukraine’s control.
The forced evacuation of civilians, which the militants announced in the territories of the so-called “LPR” and “DPR” on February 18, 2021, was a pre-planned operation. According to metadata, a video with “LPR leader” Leonid Pasichnyk about the evacuation was recorded at least two days before its publication on February 16. The video of DNR leader Denis Pushylin with a similar appeal was also recorded on February 16. That is, even before “Ukraine launched an attack” according to Russia.
All this indicates that the reasons for the “evacuation” of the population were invented in advance. Meanwhile, the militants rejected the offer of the Ukrainian side to hold an extraordinary meeting of the Tripartite Contact Group – a group of representatives from Ukraine, the OSCE and Russia, formed for a diplomatic solution to the war in Donbas.",0

Ukraine-NATO relations date back to the 90s. At the time, Ukraine was one of the first countries to join the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program. Ties strengthened with the signing in 1997 of the Charter on a Distinctive Partnership that established the NATO-Ukraine Commission (NUC), a body overseeing the development of relations and cooperation and supporting Ukraine’s efforts to advance reforms to pursue its Euro-Atlantic aspirations. A NATO Information and Documentation Center in Ukraine (since 1997) and a NATO Liaison Office (since 1999) are there to support cooperation on the ground.

47,"First, there is no need to involve Russia in the so-called “Ukrainian conflict” because Russia is its aggressor. This was recognized by 47 UN countries. There is a lot of evidence of the Russian troops’ presence in Donbas, as well as the direct governance of Moscow in “LPR” and “DPR”. Their overview in the following article.
Second, there is no evidence from independent observers (including the OSCE SMM, which worked directly in the region) that Kyiv has resorted to terrorist attacks or sabotage in the Donbas. As well as the fact that other countries, including the United States, may have been involved.
With “chemical attacks” Russia has intimidated the population of Donbas for years, at least since 2018. In 2021, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was the first to report on “chemical weapons in the Donbas.” Later, the leader of the so-called “DPR” Denis Pushylin picked up this information flow. The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine called it disinformation, and the US State Department also denied it.
They also recalled that in recent years, the Russian government has used chemical weapons twice to attack as well as attempt to kill its opponents, particularly on foreign territory.
There is no reason to claim that Ukraine was preparing to attack Donbas Since 2014 the representatives of the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly stressed that they are not considering a forceful scenario to return the occupied Donbas. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine did not plan any offensive operations in Donbas.

The “Orange Revolution” in 2004 rotation of the “Euromaidan”, which later transformed into the “Revolution of Dignity” in 2014 – is a direct proof of the power of the Ukrainian electorate itself.

After Ukraine left the USSR and became an independent state, Western countries provided financial support to stabilize and develop its economy. Thus, since 1991, the United States has provided Ukraine with about $5 billion to solve current problems: liquidation of the consequences of the Chernobyl accident, anti-corruption measures, energy development, etc. Ukraine has received a total of $35 billion from the IMF over 30 years of independence. The purpose of raising funds is to stabilize the financial system and carry out structural reforms for economic growth.

Its entry into force was even postponed until 2016 due to Russia’s claims that a significant increase in European supplies will displace Russian products from the Ukrainian market, and uncompetitive Ukrainian goods and illegal ones from the EU will seize the markets of the customs union.
At present, the EU has indeed become Ukraine’s main trading partner. According to the results of 2021, the share of trade in goods and services with the EU amounted to 39.0% of the total. The share of Russian exports is also declining every year: if in 2013 Russia accounted for 25.6% of all exports from Ukraine, in 2021 – 5%. The same goes for imports: in 9 years it has decreased by 20%. However, the reasons for this are not so much the liberalization of trade conditions with the EU as the established tariffs, quotas and sanctions.
But a significant economic blow to Ukraine has been inflicted and is being inflicted by Russian aggression. The country’s real GDP in 2014, when Russia attacked Ukraine, illegally annexed Crimea and started the war in the Donbas, fell by 6.5% and another 9.8% in 2015.",0
54,"In March, 2021, Russia began to reinforce its military presence along the Ukrainian border in the north, east and south. Then in the Bryansk, Voronezh, Rostov regions and on the territory of the temporarily occupied Crimea, the Russian Federation deployed 28 battalion tactical groups put on wartime alert. Troops were recruited under the disguise of military exercises. By May, the Ukrainian government had estimated that Russia had concentrated up to 100,000 troops along Ukraine’s borders and in the occupied Crimea. Moscow, meanwhile, claimed it was responding to Kyiv’s provocations aimed at escalating the Donbas conflict. According to observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), there were no provocations.
Moreover, before Russia’s moving of troops to Ukraine’s borders in the spring of 2021, it were Russian-controlled militants, who had increased the number of shellings and heavy weapons which they, on the contrary, were to withdraw.
Thus, the number of ceasefire violations in early 2021 increased. But the vast majority of these violations were committed by militants, not Ukrainian troops. The observations of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine for January-March 2021 state: 98% of the total number of ceasefire violations were recorded in areas not controlled by the Ukrainian government. The mission recorded more than 500 weapons deployed in violation of agreed withdrawal lines. About 95% of them are in territories not under Ukraine’s control.
Representatives of the Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly stressed since 2014 that they are not considering a forceful scenario for the return of the occupied Donbas. The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny, the Minister of Defense Oleksiy Reznikov, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba, the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine did not plan any offensive operations in Donbas. The only possible means declared were political and diplomatic.
shortly before Russia’s full-scale attack. on Ukraine, propaganda media reported that Volodymyr Zelensky had ordered to invade Donbas. In fact, Zelensky has never made such statements. Such a decree did not appear neither on the website of the President of Ukraine nor in official publications, in which, according to Ukrainian law, this act had to be published. The US State Department stressed that Russian military and intelligence agencies are misinforming the world about the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ attack on Donbas in order to portray Ukraine and Ukrainian officials as aggressors. In the same mold, Russia occupied part of Georgia in 2008 and did not withdraw its troops and ammunition from Moldova, where they still remain without government consent.
Data on the number of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are regularly published on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. In December 2021, there were more than 201,000 servicemen in the Armed Forces. Slightly more than 40,000 of them took part in the Joint Forces (JFO) operation in Donbas. So, clearly, not half of the army of Ukraine. As for the Minsk agreements, it is Russia which has not yet ensured the implementation of security points. Nor has it implemented the measures to strengthen the ceasefire since July 2020.",0
55,"Economic relations with Russia have indeed become much colder since Russian troops invaded Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and occupied Crimea. According to the State Statistics Service, when in 2013, 25.6% of all exports were to Russia, in 2021 – 5%. The same goes for imports: in 9 years it has decreased by 20%. The reason for this is the tariffs, quotas, and sanctions imposed in recent years, which affected the economies of both countries.
But it doesn’t mean default or economic collapse: according to KSE analysts, as of February 2022, compared to 2014, economic indicators are acceptable, the macrofinancial situation is stable, the economy is diversified, and now has no critical dependence on Russia. The NBU has a sufficient level of reserves (about $30 billion) to curb devaluation and smooth out currency shocks if they occur.
The fight against corruption is slow but ongoing: even after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office, established after the Revolution of Dignity, continue to operate. Moreover, it turned out that the war had a positive effect on the corruptionists and their moral qualities.",0
56,"When the threat of a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine’s territory began to increase, the United States stood with Ukraine. Joe Biden has repeatedly expressed the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggression in Donbas and Crimea.
From 2014 to January 2022, the EU provided Ukraine with around € 17 billion in grants and loans, of which € 9.6 billion in financial support came from the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Also, from 2014 to 2021, the United States provided more than $2.5 billion in security assistance.",0
57,"Allegations of an alleged coup d’etat in the downtown of Kyiv are typical rhetoric of the Kremlin, which thus justifies its own aggression. Putin himself mentions it again and again: at the Russian Security Council in January 2021, which preceded the recognition of the LPR and the DPR and the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and at a “meeting” with Aeroflot workers in the spring of 2022, when the Russian military have already carried out active military actions in our territory. We have already refuted this and his other statements in the materials “The Crooked Mirror of Russian propaganda. Factcheck of Putin’s New Speech”, ” The World’s Chief Liar” and ”Putin’s Lie Council“. Analysis of the meeting of the Security Council of the Russian Federation”.
The Revolution of dignity has absolutely no signs of a coup d’etat.
The main goal of the coup d’etat is to seize power by conspirators in conformity with their own interests. The Revolution of Dignity began with actions in support of the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU – Euromaidan – and later evolved into mass protests aimed at protecting human and civil rights and freedoms, democratic values. Power and profit have never been its goal. The result of the revolution was the ratification of the Agreement with the EU and the holding of fair presidential and parliamentary elections.
The conspiracy presupposes the presence of a small group of people and is in no way a mass phenomenon.
According to a sociological poll conducted in October 2014 by the Ilko Kucheriv Foundation for Democratic Initiatives, about 20% of Ukraine’s population, more than 8.5 million people, took part in peaceful rallies. The poll showed that most citizens perceived participating in the protests as a conscious struggle for their rights.
Other signs of a coup d’etat are unconstitutionality and violence, when weapons are the main tool to achieve the goal. All the events of the Revolution of Dignity took place in a constitutional manner, and the protesters began to use self-defense only after the escalation of violence by the authorities, which involved armed security forces to disperse unarmed protesters.",0
58,"Representatives of the pseudo-republics, the so-called “LPR” and “DPR”, claim that the Armed Forces create obstacles for OSCE SMM observers. The OSCE SMM itself does not confirm these cases.
Instead, the Mission has repeatedly reported that LDPR militants are obstructing their work. For example, on October 17, 2021, they blocked SMM observers in hotels in occupied Donetsk and Horlivka. After that, the Mission even announced the suspension of work in eastern Ukraine.
The Mission’s reports also show that the militants have repeatedly restricted the freedom of movement of SMM members. Only in July-September 2021, the observers were not allowed to enter certain areas more than 250 times. 90% of the recorded cases occurred in territories not under Ukraine’s control.
In 2022, the occupiers also threatened to “arrest and imprison Mission observers if they did not leave the area.”
The SMM has repeatedly reported that the drones were jammed by militants. For example, according to this Mission report, in just one day, the occupiers suppressed OSCE drones during 16 flights. There were cases when militants simply shot down drones over pseudo-republics.
The Ukrainian side of the Joint Control and Coordination Center (JCCC) stated that the occupiers obstructed the work of the OSCE Mission UAV not only in the occupied but also in the territory controlled by Ukraine by means of electronic warfare.
Realizing that the OSCE Mission was in fact recording Russian crimes against Ukraine, Russia tried to get rid of it, so in September 2021 it simply did not extend the OSCE’s mandate after September 30 at the Gukovo and Donetsk checkpoints on the border with Ukraine. These are the key checkpoints through which the militants connect with Russia by rail – and, accordingly, the transfer of weapons and mercenaries from Russia to the occupied territories.",0
59,"The Russian military led operations to seize power in the occupied Donbas.
In March 2014, there were rallies in Donetsk and Luhansk: in favor of joining Russia and uniting with Ukraine. Local witnesses said people had been brought from the Russian border to participate in pro-Russian rallies.
In April, armed men (local and Russian citizens) began to capture city authorities in the Donbas region. According to a Radio Liberty investigation, Russian army officers led the operations. The separatists proclaimed the so-called “DPR” on April 7, 2014, and the “LPR” on April 27, 2014.
According to a Bellingcat investigation, military units liquidated all Ukrainian authorities in the occupied territories in April and May and began shelling Ukrainian cities with heavy artillery. They opened fire from the occupied territories of Ukraine and Russia.
However, they failed to stop the Armed Forces’ offensive. The Kremlin sent 4,000 regular army soldiers to Donbas in August 2014, an Atlantic Council report said. Using satellite images, Bellingcat established that Russian troops had crossed the border. The Russian military took an active part in the fighting, and their intervention turned the tide of the battle.
According to Ukrainian intelligence reports, at least 11 Russian generals commanded the “troops” made up of the DNR and LNR groups.
In February 2014, the same Verkhovna Rada that had operated under fugitive president Viktor Yanukovych (not the “West”) appointed the new government.
After the bloodiest days of the Revolution of Dignity (48 unarmed protesters were killed in Kyiv on February 20), Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine and stopped communicating. Verkhovna Rada passed a resolution saying President Yanukovych had resigned from his constitutional power. Based on this, it appointed Oleksandr Turchynov President of Ukraine, on February 23. The then convocation of Verkhovna Rada voted for the new government and prime minister on February 27. Therefore, the Ukrainian government’s “illegitimacy” is a Russian propaganda myth.
The Ukrainian military in the East is at war with militants whom Russia supplies with Russian troops and weapons.
Evidence of Russian troops and military equipment in Donbas is plentiful. We will provide it in this article.",0
60,"Ukraine did not have a “coup d’etat” in 2014 but the Revolution of Dignity. When the then pro-Russian authorities announced the suspension of preparations for the country’s associate membership in the European Union, Ukrainians staged peaceful protests to maintain the pro-European orientation. After three months of protests, violent confrontations, and hundreds of casualties, early presidential elections were called followed by early parliamentary elections, in compliance with all constitutional requirements. In the same year, the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union was ratified.
The coup d’etat is an unconstitutional seizure of power by a small group of individuals and conspirators acting in their own interests. The Revolution of Dignity began with peaceful protests by unarmed people supporting democratization. The authorities tried to suppress them by force, forcing them to use self-defense, and it was massive. You can read more about why the Revolution of Dignity is not a coup d’etat in VoxCheck’s article The Maidan in 2014 is a coup d’état: a review of Italian and German pro-Russian media.
The driving force of the Revolution of Dignity was the people and their civic initiative. The role of nationalist forces was negligible.",0
61,"Nazi and communist ideologies are officially banned in Ukraine. Right-wing radical movements are indeed present in the country, a fact exploited by Russian propaganda outlets. However, their importance and prevalence are exaggerated. In addition, there are radical right-wing movements, including Nazis and etremists. The rallies held on January 1 on Stepan Bandera’s birthday were not massive or nationwide.
Stepan Bandera was a prominent figure in the Ukrainian national liberation movement in the 1930s and 1950s, leading the anti-German and anti-Soviet struggle. Later, his name came to symbolize the movement itself. In 1941, he was arrested by the Nazis and put in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp for proclaiming the restoration of the Ukrainian state in Lviv. He refused to cooperate with Germans. From 1942 to 1944, Bandera was in a German concentration camp, and so he could not cooperate with the German military.",0
